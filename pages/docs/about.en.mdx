# About Pulsate

Pulsate is an open-source decentralized social network software. Development began on September 10, 2023, and it has been greatly influenced by existing decentralized social networks such as Mastodon and Misskey.

<TipCallout>
  The name **Pulsate** comes from the album "PULSATE" by indigo la End, a band that the developer [m1sk9](https://github.com/m1sk9) likes.

## Decentralized / ActivityPub

**Decentralized** refers to a network formed by multiple servers existing separately and communicating with each other. Communicating with a single server to form a network is called **centralized**, and most modern services such as X (Twitter), Facebook, and Instagram are centralized.

Pulsate implements **ActivityPub**, a protocol for decentralized social networks. Because ActivityPub provides a standardized model for communication between applications, users can follow and share posts with users on other servers (like Mastodon or Misskey) that implement ActivityPub.

## Features

Pulsate has the following features. {/*You can check the differences from existing major decentralized social networks like Mastodon and Misskey in the [comparison]() section. */}

- üèéÔ∏è **Performance**: Pulsate is designed to be faster than other ActivityPub implementations like Misskey and Mastodon.
- üåé **Federation**: Pulsate is a decentralized social network that communicates with other servers (like Misskey and Mastodon) using the ActivityPub protocol.
- ü™Ñ **Customizable**: Pulsate is designed to be easily modified and customized. You can change its appearance, add new features, or remove existing ones. **It also has strong community support, making it easy to develop third-party clients**.
- üîí **Security**: Pulsate emphasizes security, ensuring the protection and safety of user data.
- ‚ù§Ô∏è **User Friendly**: Pulsate is designed to be user-friendly, with a clean and intuitive interface that's easy to use.
