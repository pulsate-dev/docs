## About the Project

#### Will an official instance be provided?

The Pulsate project team plans to offer an official instance up until the v1 (stable version) release, but it is undecided whether it will continue to be offered afterward.

If it is provided, it will be done **as the Pulsate project team**, and not as a separate organization.

#### Will native apps (iOS, Android) be available?

Yes. We plan to offer them, and we also welcome third-party clients from the community.

#### Is there a way to join the project team?

Thank you for your interest in joining the project team. If you wish to join, please join our [Discord](https://link.pulsate.dev) and send a DM to `@laminne33569`.

#### Where can I check the progress of the project?

You can check the progress of the project on [GitHub](https://link.pulsate.dev/github). We also share updates on Discord.

#### Is there any relation to Misskey or Mastodon?

No, there isn't. Pulsate is a different project from Misskey and Mastodon, with different project founders and main developers.
